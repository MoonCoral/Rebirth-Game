tile characters: > = slide tile to the right (->) until hitting a wall, pit or normal floor
tile characters: v = slide tile downwards until hitting a wall, pit or normal floor
tile characters: ^ = slide tile upwards until hitting a wall, pit or normal floor 
pits reset to start of the room
player tethered to clone, max distance between them: 4 tiles (P--Q)
win condition: all switches pressed (perma switches, stay on once pressed)
hooks : only one character can stay on this tile; if occupied and another one comes accross, slides through to the next tile
both characters (player and clone) can stand on the same switch tile
if max tether size reached, characters can't move away from each other (even if affected by other forces => anchored)
if win, unlock chest, get reward
can switch control to clone
